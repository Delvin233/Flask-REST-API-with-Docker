Virtual Machine is an emualtion of an OS
And this approach to virtualizsation is less efficient


For this reason Docker Containers we created
Docker Containers run on the cloud, on linux based system
They sacrifice efficient over flexibility
So in a VM we can run windows on a Mac
but in Docker Containers, the containers run on Linux

Operating Systems
Made up of the kernel and the files(programs)
The kernel interacts with and controls the hardware

Noooowwww.... How do we run Docker locally?
A Linux VM is needed for that 
Docker Desktop is going to be used (though inefficent since we would be
        hardware > Windows or Mac > Hypervisor > Linux Vm > Docker > Docker Containers
)
We use Docker Images, created from Dockerfiles to create the Container

code to build the docker image
docker build -t flask-smorest-api .

it is for tag

code to run docker with a volume to allow live updates
docker run -dp 5005:5000 -w /app -v /home/user/Flask-REST-API-with-Docker:/app  flask-smorest-api:latest 

-w is the file were working with 
-v is the the volume and its where we place the path to our folder so it is incorporated to docker
